# Eulerian Path

By Ke Zhang

## Introduction
An **Eulerian path** (or Eulerian trail) is a trail in a finite graph that visits every edge only once, allowing for revisiting nodes.

An **Eulerian circuit** (or Eulerian cycle) is an Eulerian path that starts and ends on the same node.

Euler proved that the necessary condition for the existance of Eulerian circuits is that all the nodes have an even degree.

**Euler's Theorem** : A connected graph has an Euler cycle if and only if every node has even degree.

## Properties
- An undirected graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if exactly zero or two vertices have odd degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component.

- An undirected graph can be decomposed into edge-disjoint cycles if and only if all of its vertices have even degree. So, a graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if it can be decomposed into edge-disjoint cycles and its nonzero-degree vertices belong to a single connected component.

- A directed graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has equal in degree and out degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single strongly connected component. 
  
- Equivalently, a directed graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if it can be decomposed into edge-disjoint directed cycles and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single strongly connected component.

## Illustration

Let's start with a list of lists, for each list inside indicates two nodes that have edges between them. For example, node1 has edges with node5, node2, node4 and node3 according to the *adjacent_list* information.

adjacent_list = [[1, 5], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 3], [5, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4], [3, 6], [4, 6]]

# ╔═╡ 5e98cb66-5017-11eb-28d8-65a7aec77180

First we need to create a dictionary whose key is each node, and the value returns a list of nodes that have edges to this node.

After converting it into a dictionary, we can check if this dictionary of nodes has an eulerian cycle or not, based on the theory: 

**An undirected graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if exactly zero or two vertices have odd degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component.**

So here we check for each key whether the length of the value is odd or even. If all of the lengths are even, the nodes have an eulerian cycle.

For eulerian path, its condition is different from the has\_eulerian\_cycle condition. If there are 0 **or** two nodes with an even degree, an eulerian path can be created.
